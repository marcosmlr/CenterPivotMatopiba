"""
The ESRI Shapefile driver supports one geometry type per layer, and this cannot be a geometry collection type.

So it would look something like this:

# this will create a directory with 1 or more shapefiles
dst = driver.CreateDataSource("common-border")
# create common-border/points.shp
pointLayer = dst.CreateLayer("points", spatialReference, ogr.wkbPoint)
# create common-border/polygons.shp
polygonLayer = dst.CreateLayer("polygons", spatialReference, ogr.wkbPolygon)
# ... as needed
dst.GetLayerCount()  # 2 layers / shapefiles

And you would need to add each geometry type to the appropriate layer. There are 
probably some really smart things you can do with dictionaries to do the mapping, 
and if a key does not exist for the geometry type, it could create the required 
layer, etc.
